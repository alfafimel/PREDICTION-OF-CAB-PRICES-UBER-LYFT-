# PREDICTION-OF-CAB-PRICES-UBER-LYFT-
PREDICTION OF CAB PRICES: Understanding and determining the factors that affect the cab prices, and predicting the costs of the trips based on the factors determined.

## Problem Statement

Uber and Lyft's ride prices are not constant like public transport. They are greatly affected by the demand and supply of rides at a given time. We would like to understand what drives the demand of the rides and how the prices vary with time and weather conditions. Times around 9 am and 5 pm should see the highest surges on account of people commuting to work/home. Another guess would be the weather; rain/snow should cause more people to take rides. 

## Objectives
To understand the factors that influence the price of a cab
To predict trip prices based on these factors
